# Pre-release for testers

This project provides early access builds through GitHub pre-releases. These versions are meant for testing only and may be unstable.

## How to create a pre-release
1. Run the **Pre Release** workflow on GitHub.
2. Provide a tag name (for example `v0.1.0-alpha.1`), title and optional release notes.
3. The workflow will publish a GitHub release marked as a pre-release.

## How to download
Navigate to the "Releases" section on GitHub and download the latest pre-release from the assets list.
